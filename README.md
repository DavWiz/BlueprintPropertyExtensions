# Blueprint Property Extensions
Extension to blueprint properties to allow various metadata to be used that is otherwise only available in C++.

## Gameplay Tag
This is currently the only variable type that has any extensions.
* `Categories`: Allows you to choose the gameplay tag "Category" (think the root/base gameplay tag) that can be selected.
